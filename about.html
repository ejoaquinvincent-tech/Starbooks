        <h2>Our Heritage</h2> <hr>
        <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. <br> <br>It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home.<br> <br>Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders. <br><br>
Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. <br> <br> After joining the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. <br> <br> It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks.<br> <br>By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse. <br> <br>
Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, Washington, D.C. and New York.<br> <br>By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999.<br> <br> Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all around the world.<br> <br> In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission: With every cup, with every conversation, with every community - we nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection.</p>
